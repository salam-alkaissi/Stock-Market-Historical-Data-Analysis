## Data Science Problem
To address the business problem, the following data science challenges are defined.

1. Pattern Detection in Stock Price Data: Analyze historical stock data to identify
trends, patterns, and anomalies in price movements over various time frames (short-term,
intermediate-term, long-term).
2. Sentiment-Driven Contextualization: Incorporate sentiment analysis of news articles
to link significant price movements with corresponding news events, helping users under-
stand the “why” behind price changes.
3. Natural Language Generation (NLG): Develop a system that translates complex
stock market behaviors into easy-to-understand textual explanations, specifically tailored
for non-technical users.
4. Automation and Scalability: Create a pipeline that dynamically retrieves stock data
and relevant news, processes it, and automatically generates historical insights daily or
over a customizable time range.
